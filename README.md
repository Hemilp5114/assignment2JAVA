**Overview**
This is a simple web-based geometry calculator that allows users to find the area of four basic shapes:

Circle (π × r²)
Triangle (½ × b × h)
Square (a × a)
Rectangle (w × h)
The project demonstrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation and event handling.

**Features**
1) User-friendly interface with an intuitive layout.
2) Input validation to ensure correct calculations.
3) JavaScript functions for real-time area calculation.
4) Smooth navigation with anchor links for each shape.
5) Responsive design with CSS styling and a gradient background.

**Technologies Used**
HTML5 (For structuring the content)
CSS3 (For styling and layout)
JavaScript (For DOM manipulation and event handling)

**Usage**
Enter the required values (radius, base, height, side, width) in the input fields.
Click the "Calculate" button to compute the area.
The result is displayed in a readonly input box.
Click "Go to top" to return to the main menu.
